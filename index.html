                <p>Im Nyonjee Zeogar. I was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota and now attending the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp. I recently made a decision to drop out from Central State University where I was pursing a bachelors in Computer
                    Science, after finding I wanted a career in web development. In my free time I do a variety of activities to keep myself busy when I’m not working. My most common activities are working out with friends, playing video games, and my
                    new found hobby coding. My goal after this program is to land some freelance opportunities as well as a career with a company in web development. </p>
